 All In Your Hands was a system developed by me on 2011 , which allows you search and reproduce different kinds of midias in your browser... such as Books, Videos, Songs and Weather Forecast.  
 
 It was developed using Java (back-end) and AngularJS (front-end); and now is being improved to run in an aws lambda environment with springboot. 
 
If you want to try out the system, please visit http://tudoemsuasmaos.com.br.  In this other url is available the system architecture draft:  https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/6171904
