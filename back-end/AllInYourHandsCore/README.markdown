Core
========

 This is the core module of the "All In Your Hands" system, which is responsible for call all APIs and format the responses in the most proper way, among other important things.    
 
 All In Your Hands was a system developed by me and maintained since 2011,  it was developed totally in Java language with a bit of other technologies such as AngularJS (web and mobile apps), JSF and Primefaces (admin module),  and MySQL ( access logs ).

where I've described the system with more details.  In this other url is available the system architecture draft:  https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/6171904

This module generate a file named "AllInYourHandsCore.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" which must be deployed into the "deploy" folder of JBoss server.
